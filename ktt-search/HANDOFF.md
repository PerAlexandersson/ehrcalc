# KTT Search Handoff

## Completed ownership record — 2026-09-06

- Owner: Codex, current Ehrcalc audit-fix session.
- The user explicitly authorized adopting this directory despite its older ownership
  record, and confirmed that no other worker is editing the repository.
- Tracked scope: `Cargo.toml`, `src/main.rs`, this handoff, and project documentation.
- Generated scan JSON, JSONL, logs, local lockfiles, and local target output are ignored
  and must remain untracked.
- Status: implementation and verification are complete; no KTT file remains actively
  owned after the final checkpoint.

## Current implementation

`ktt-search` is a workspace binary for bounded exact KTT coefficient-positivity and
Hibi–Stanley scans backed by the `gt_ehrhart` MariaDB/MySQL table. It calls the
maintained `ehrcalc-kostka-engine` implementation and stores exact polynomials and h*
vectors.

The 2026-09-06 audit fixed these correctness defects:

- upper and lower flag requests are rejected independently when malformed;
- reaching `--max-cases` produces `status: "capped"` and `capped: true`;
- a database hit reloads its dimension, Kostka value, exact polynomial, and h* vector;
  the scanner parses and cross-validates them, reruns coefficient and Hibi–Stanley
  checks, and counts the row as `cached_verified` only if every check succeeds;
- malformed or inconsistent cached rows become `cached_unverified`, record
  `first_unverified`, and force an `incomplete` rather than no-failure conclusion;
- the Hibi ranges exclude invalid endpoints, including the dimension-two square
  regression h* = `(1,6,1)`;
- `--continue-after-first` retains the first witness rather than overwriting it.

Five focused unit tests cover flag independence, terminal status, exact stored
polynomial parsing, cached-row coefficient validation, and both endpoints of the Hibi
range. Strict Clippy passes for the entire workspace with `--all-targets -D warnings`.

## Historical report warning

The ignored JSON reports predate these corrections. In particular, a report labeled
`completed` may actually have stopped at a cap, and database skips in old reports were
not revalidated. Those reports are retained only as local work data and must not be
used as certified no-failure evidence. Rerun any range whose conclusion matters.
